# Relaxer App

This is a Relaxer App created as part of Brad Traversy's "20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript" course. The app is designed to help users practice breathing exercises by guiding them through a breathing cycle: inhale, hold, and exhale. The app features an animated circle that visually indicates when to breathe in, hold, and breathe out, making it a simple yet effective tool for relaxation and mindfulness.
